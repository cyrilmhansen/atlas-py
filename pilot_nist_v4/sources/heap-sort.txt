heapsort
heapsort
(algorithm)
Definition:
A
sort
algorithm that builds a
heap
, then repeatedly extracts the maximum item. Run time is
O(n log n)
.
Generalization
(I am a kind of ...)
in-place sort
.
Specialization
(... is a kind of me.)
adaptive heap sort
,
smoothsort
.
Aggregate child
(... is a part of or used in me.)
build-heap
,
heap
,
sift up
.
See also
selection sort
.
Note:
Heapsort can be seen as a variant of
selection sort
in which sorted items are arranged (in a
heap
) to quickly find the next item.
Some times called "tournament sort" by analogy between a heap, with its
heap property
, and a tree of matches in a sports tournament.

Algorithm 232 Heapsort
, CACM, 7(6):378-348, June 1964.
Although Williams clearly stated the idea of heapsort, Floyd gave a complete, efficient implementation nearly identical to what we use today.
