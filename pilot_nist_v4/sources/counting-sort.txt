counting sort
counting sort
(algorithm)
Definition:
A 2-pass
sort
algorithm that is efficient when the number of distinct
keys
is small compared to the number of items. The first pass counts the occurrences of each key in an auxiliary
array
, and then makes a running total so each auxiliary entry is the number of preceding keys. The second pass puts each item in its final place according to the auxiliary entry for that key.

Note:
A bucket sort uses fixed-size buckets. A histogram sort sets up buckets of exactly the right size in a first pass. A counting sort is a histogram sort with one bucket per possible key value. A pigeonhole sort is a counting sort that moves items to the auxiliary array instead of counting them.
