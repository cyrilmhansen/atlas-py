quicksort
quicksort
(algorithm)
Definition:
Pick an element from the array (the pivot),
partition
the remaining elements into those greater than and less than this pivot, and
recursively
sort the partitions. There are many variants of the basic scheme above: to select the pivot, to partition the array, to stop the recursion or switch to another algorithm for small partitions, etc.

Note:
Quicksort has running time
Θ(n²)
in the
worst case
, but it is typically
O(n log n)
. In practical situations, a finely tuned implementation of quicksort beats most sort algorithms, including sort algorithms whose theoretical complexity is O(n log n) in the worst case.
Select
can be used to always pick good pivots, thus giving a variant with
O(n log n)
worst-case running time.
Newer variants, such as
dual-pivot quicksort
, are faster because they access less memory.
