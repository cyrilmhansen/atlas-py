binary search
binary search
(algorithm)
Definition:
Search a
sorted array
by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search
key
is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Note:
Run time is
O(ln n)
.
Finding the middle is often coded as
mid = (high + low)/2;
This overflows if high and low are close to the largest expressible integer. The following gives the same result and never overflows, if high and low are non-negative.
mid = low + (high - low)/2;

Binary search may be effective with an
ordered linked list
. It makes O(n) traversals, as does
linear search
, but it only performs O(log n) comparisons.
