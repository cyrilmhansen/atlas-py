depth-first search
depth-first search
(algorithm)
Definition:
(1) Any search algorithm that considers outgoing
edges
(
children
) of a
vertex
before any of the vertex's
siblings
, that is, outgoing edges of the vertex's predecessor in the search. Extremes are searched first. This is easily implemented with
recursion
. (2) An algorithm that marks all vertices in a
directed graph
in the order they are discovered and finished, partitioning the graph into a
forest
.
Also known as
DFS.
Specialization
(... is a kind of me.)
preorder traversal
,
in-order traversal
,
postorder traversal
.

breadth-first search
,

Note:
Depth-first search doesn't specify if a vertex is considered before, during, or after its outgoing edges or children. Thus it can be
preorder
,
in-order
, or
postorder traversal
.

Uses just "depth-first search" in the body (page 5), but contrasts depth-first with breadth-first search in a footnote.
An earlier description of what we would call depth-first search with pruning of infeasible solutions.
